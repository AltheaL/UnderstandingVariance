All code to generate the respective datasets have been uploaded.

With the exception of Movement with Flip & Movement without Flip.
The first dataset (Movement without Flip) was made through powerpoint, where the object in the powerpoint slide was centered,
and moved by a single press on a directional key before being saved as a picture for model training afterwards.

The second dataset (Movement with Flip) was a duplicate of the first (Movement without Flip),
and additionally duplicated again but inverted.
