The code is run with more epochs (300) and the loss value of each have been captured.

The excel has sheets for each dataset and the loss value tagged to each epoch, where the calculation for the learning values are done.
Additionally, the values are colour coded by the column, where higher values are coded towards green and lower values are coded towards red (Excel Conditional Formatting)

However, the RNN values are largely incomplete.
